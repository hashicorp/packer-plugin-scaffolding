# Packer Plugin Scaffolding

This repository is a template for a Packer multi-component plugin. It is intended as a starting point for creating Packer plugins, containing:
- A builder ([builder/scaffolding](builder/scaffolding))
- A provisioner ([provisioner/scaffolding](provisioner/scaffolding))
- A post-processor ([post-processor/scaffolding](provisioner/scaffolding))
- A data source ([datasource/scaffolding](datasource/scaffolding))
- Docs ([docs](docs))
- A working example ([example](example))

These folders contain boilerplate code that you will need to edit to create your own Packer multi-component plugin.
A full guide to creating Packer plugins can be found at [Extending Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/plugins/creation).

In this repository you will also find a pre-defined GitHub Action configuration for the release workflow
(`.goreleaser.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`). The release workflow configuration makes sure the GitHub
release artifacts are created with the correct binaries and naming conventions.

Please see the [GitHub template repository documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for how to create a new repository from this template on GitHub.

## Running Acceptance Tests

Make sure to install the plugin with `go build .` and to have Packer installed locally.
Then source the built binary to the plugin path with `cp packer-plugin-scaffolding ~/.packer.d/plugins/packer-plugin-scaffolding`
Once everything needed is set up, run:
```
PACKER_ACC=1 go test -count 1 -v ./... -timeout=120m
```

This will run the acceptance tests for all plugins in this set.

## Test Plugin Example Action

This scaffolding configures a [manually triggered plugin test action](/.github/workflows/test-plugin-example.yml). 
By default, the action will run Packer at the latest version to init, validate, and build the example configuration 
within the [example](example) folder. This is useful to quickly test a basic template of your plugin against Packer.

The example must contain the `required_plugins` block and require your plugin at the latest or any other released version.
This will help test and validate plugin releases.

## Registering Documentation on Packer.io

Documentation for a plugin is maintained within the `docs` directory and served on GitHub.
To include plugin docs on Packer.io a GitHub workflow has been added to this template repository that
can be used generate a documentation structure that can be consumed remotely by Packer.io.
See the workflow [generated-docs-artifacts.yml](.github/workflows/generate-dos-artifacts.yml)

After merging the generated files to the default branch for the plugin repository

you will need to open a one time pull-request against [hashicorp/packer](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer) to register the plugin docs.
This is done by adding the block below for the respective plugin to the file `website/data/docs-remote-navigation.js`.

```json
{
   "title": "Scaffolding",
   "path": "scaffolding",
   "repo": "hashicorp/packer-plugin-scaffolding",
   "branch": "main",
   "artifaceDir": ".doc-artifacts"
 }
```


The documentation structure needed for Packer.io can be generated manually, but it is
encouraged to use the action on release events so that documentation stays up to date.

Requirements:  Nodejs and NPM

In the plugin root execute the command packer-docs-artifact command

```
> npx -p @hashicorp/packer-docs-artifacts generate
```

The generated files will be placed under `PLUGIN_ROOT/.doc-artifacts`; this directory contains all the docs
and respective navigation information needed for including the plugin docs under packer.io/docs/

A one time pull-request will needs to be opened against [hashicorp/packer](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer) to register the plugin docs.
This is done by adding the block below for the respective plugin to the file `website/data/docs-remote-navigation.js`.

```json
{
   "title": "Scaffolding",
   "path": "scaffolding",
   "repo": "hashicorp/packer-plugin-scaffolding",
   "branch": "main",
   "artifaceDir": ".doc-artifacts"
 }
```
