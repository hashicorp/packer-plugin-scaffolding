# Packer Plugin Scaffolding

This repository is a template for a Packer multi-plugin. It is intended as a starting point for creating Packer plugins, containing:
- A builder (`builder/scaffolding`)
- A provisioner (`provisioner/scaffolding`)
- A post-processor (`post-processor/scaffolding`)
- Docs (`docs/`)

These files contain boilerplate code that you will need to edit to create your own Packer multi-plugin.
A full guide to creating Packer plugins can be found at [Extending Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending).

In this repository you will also find a pre-defined GitHub Action configuration for the release workflow
(`.goreleaser.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`).

Please see the [GitHub template repository documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for how to create a new repository from this template on GitHub.
