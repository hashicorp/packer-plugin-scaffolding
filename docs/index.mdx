# Scaffolding Plugins

<!--
  Include a short overview about the plugin.
-->

The Scaffolding plugin is intended as a starting point for creating Packer plugins, containing:

- [builder](/docs/builder/scaffolding`) - The scaffolding builder is used to create endless Packer
  plugins using a consistent plugin structure.

- [provisioner](/docs/provisioner/scaffolding`) - The scaffolding provisioner is used to provisioner
  Packer builds.

- [post-processor](/docs/post-processor/scaffolding`) - The scaffolding post-processor is used to
  export scaffolding builds.

<!--
  The overview page is a good place to document shared configuration or special environment configuration
  settings such as authentication, debugging guides, etc. Essentially any additional text that a user
  should be aware of to successfully use the plugin.

  Some additional sections include:

  ### Authentication

  ### Environment Variables
