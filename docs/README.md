  plugins using a consistent plugin structure.

- [provisioner](/docs/provisioners/provisioner-name.mdx) - The scaffolding provisioner is used to provisioner
  Packer builds.

- [post-processor](/docs/post-processors/postprocessor-name.mdx) - The scaffolding post-processor is used to
  export scaffolding builds.

- [data source](/docs/datasources/datasource-name.mdx) - The scaffolding data source is used to
  export scaffolding data.
